<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

**Purpose**

- The purpose of this project is to document and demonstrate how to incrementally adopt `TypeScript` on an existing Javascript `create-react-app` project.

**Problem**

- Converting a Javascript create-react-app to TypeScript should be done incrementally so that we can gain access to TypeScript's "good parts" without losing the flexibility need to keep delivering new features to a project in development.

**Scope**

- This project is intended to show you how to incrementally adopt TypeScript on existing Javascript `create-react-app` projects. For new `create-react-app` projects please refer to their documentation on [Creating a TypeScript app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#creating-a-typescript-app).

**Background: What led us to this point? How did we get here?**

- We aspire to [Continuously deliver (CD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) software to our userbase, and adopting TypeScript in our projects will help us get closer to achieving it.

### Built With

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS -->

## Acknowledgments

The intial version of this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

<!-- AVAILABLE SCRIPTS -->

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
